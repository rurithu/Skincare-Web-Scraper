# Skincare Web Scraper Project

## Introduction 

I have always struggled with finding skincare that works for me, and scrolling through pages of pages of products usually leaves me even more confused with 100+ tabs opened on my browser, so I created a Web Scraper that Scrapes through Skincare products on the ULTA website that I can filter for my preferences.

## Tools 

* `Python`
* `Scrapy Package`
* `sqlite3`

## Tutorial 

Before you get started make sure that you are able to establish a database connection in `pipelines.py`
Clone repository and run `scrapy crawl ultaSpider` on command line.
View the database using `sqlite3` commands on the command line, or download a SQL database viewer.
Then you can filter for your preferences, like product type, product price, or ingredients that work with your skin. 
It's that simple!
